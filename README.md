# Gender segregation and DV rates NSW

This repository contains my paper 'Spatial analysis of Gender segregation in the workforce and the relationship to domestic violence rates in NSW LGA's' that I wrote as part of the course DATA5207 Data Analysis in the Social Sciences at the University of Sydney. 

Due to limitations in public GitHub repositories, I was not able to upload all data files and all outputs. 

However, the final paper can be accessed through Research_Project.pdf. All code and text used to generate this paper with latex engine xelatex are contained in Research_Project.rmd.

interactive_maps.rmd generates interactive maps of different variable, however the original output interactive_maps.html is too large to upload. Mapbox was used to generate these interactive maps.
